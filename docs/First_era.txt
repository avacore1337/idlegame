Evolution points: x*5 % gain to all resources,
Genes:

1 Brain size: research++
2 Dedicated thinker: research when clicking++
2 Daydreaming: all owned tiles gives a small base research
3 Genetic memory: start with technologies in first era



1 Muscle size: base resource gain++
2 Dexterous: gain more when refining
2 Hard worker: resources when clicking++
3 Resourcefull Ancestors: start with X in all base resources


1 Traveler: buying range ++
2 Hunger management: less food needed when expanding
2 Bountiful gains: food gain++
3 Bountifull start: start with X in food

(unlocked by buiding in era 2? )
1 Advanced evolution: evolution point bonus + %
2 Faster evolution: evolution point gain++
2 adapting civilization: cheaper era
3 Leaping civilization: start in era X
3 automation
